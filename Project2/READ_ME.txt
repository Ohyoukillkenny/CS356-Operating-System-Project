I have run every code smoothly on my PC. If you find I forget hand in some assignments or hand in wrong file. Please contact with me right away by phone: 13968938250, email: kenny_kong@foxmail.com

The Prj2_report contains the COMMENT of the code and the usage of the code. 
And it explained the analysis for my prj in detail.

The prj2_pic contains all of my experiments' data's screen-shot.

And in code file, the android_code contains my own android app's main code.(Because the whole file is too large, so I just handle the main java code and main menu xml code)
In modify_kernel file, there are my code to modify the kernel.
In Original_kernel_code, there are kernel's original code.

In set_Sched file, I write 3 program to change the scheduler of the kernel.
And the setZygote_desc need to use the OS Prj1's system call to change all of the zygote's descendants in one time. So it will use the sys_ptree file's code

Finally, I wrote a test application in arm_application file. It is used to be contender.
